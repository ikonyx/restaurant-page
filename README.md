# 🍽️ Baratie Restaurant 

This is a fan-made interactive restaurant website inspired by the legendary Baratie from *One Piece*, built entirely using **JavaScript for DOM manipulation**, and bundled using **Webpack**. No HTML is hard-coded beyond the basic structure. All content is dynamically generated with JavaScript modules.
